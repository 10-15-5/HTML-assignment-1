		<p><strong>Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. 
		Litecoin was an early bitcoin spinoff or altcoin, starting in October 2011. In technical details, Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011 by Charlie Lee, a Google employee who later became Engineering Director at Coinbase. The Litecoin network went live on October 13, 2011. 
		It was a source code fork of the Bitcoin Core client, differing primarily by having a decreased block generation time (2.5 minutes), increased maximum number of coins, 
		different hashing algorithm (scrypt, instead of SHA-256), and a slightly modified GUI.</strong></p>
