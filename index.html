		<p><strong>A cryptocurrency, crypto currency or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of
			computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.
			It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
			Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining.
			They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users
			using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies have been created.</strong></p>
